# Advanced JWT Guide

## Overview
This repository provides an in-depth guide on JSON Web Token (JWT) concepts, covering security, performance optimization, authentication, and best practices. It includes examples, diagrams, and implementations for advanced JWT use cases.

## Introduction to JWT
- What are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)?
- Structure of a JWT
- How JWTs enable stateless authentication

## Security & Threats
- What are JWT Key ID (kid) headers and their security benefits?
- Mitigating JWT brute-force attacks
- Handling compromised JWT signing keys
- Preventing JWT signature confusion attacks
- Preventing JWT downgrade attacks (e.g., forcing HS256 over RS256)
- Risks of using JWTs without expiration (exp claim)

## JWT Best Practices & Management
- Handling JWTs in a serverless environment (AWS Lambda, Firebase)
- Importance of the iss (issuer) claim
- Securely logging JWTs without exposing sensitive data
- JWT introspection in OAuth2 and its use cases
- Detached JWTs and their applications
- Trade-offs between JWTs and session-based authentication

## JWT in Distributed Systems & Microservices
- Handling JWT validation in a multi-tenant SaaS application
- Implementing cross-service authentication using JWTs in microservices
- Managing JWT revocation in a stateless system
- Securely sharing JWTs across multiple domains
- Preventing single JWTs from being used across multiple regions

## Performance & Optimization
- Reducing JWT parsing time in high-performance APIs
- Impact of JWTs on database queries and performance
- Lazy validation of JWT claims to optimize performance
- JWT compression (Gzip, Brotli) and its security implications

## Advanced JWT Usage & Interoperability
- Self-issued OpenID Connect (OIDC) JWTs and how they work
- Using JWTs for delegated authorization between third-party services
- Implementing JWT-based Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple applications
- Handling JWTs in IoT device authentication
- JWT verification in a Zero Trust security model
